Like ML, you need a unified platform to create an end-to-end workflow for production quality applications. Below is an example of how this works on Databricks: In this session, learn how to build agents to access all your data and models through function calling. Then, learn how DSPy enables agent interaction with each other to ensure the question is answered correctly. We will demonstrate a chatbot, powered by multiple agents, to be able to answer questions and reason answers the base LLM does not know and very specialized topics. /Delivery Solutions Architect"}

NVIDIA NeMo Framework Megatron-LM on Databricks is an open source solution that integrates GPU acceleration and advanced parallelism with Databricks Delta Lakehouse, streamlining workflows for pre-training and fine-tuning models at scale. This session highlights context parallelism, a unique NeMo capability for parallelizing over sequence lengths, making it ideal for video datasets with large embeddings. Through the case study of TwelveLabs\u2019 Pegasus-1 model, learn how NeMo empowers scalable multimodal AI development, from text to video processing, setting a new standard for LLM workflows. /Chief Technology Officer & Co-Founder\nTwelve Labs, Inc /Solutions Architect - NVIDIA"}
