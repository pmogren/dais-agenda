The stakes are high, new insights surfaced represent potential care improvement and lives positively impacted. Using Genie and our AI-ready data in Unity Catalog, our team was able to stand up a Genie instance in three short days, bypassing costs and time of custom modeling and application development. Additionally, Genie allowed our internal teams to generate complex SQL, as much as 10 times faster than writing it by hand. As Genie and lakehouse apps continue to advance rapidly, we are excited to leverage these features by introducing Genie to as many as 20,000 users across hundreds of hospitals.
