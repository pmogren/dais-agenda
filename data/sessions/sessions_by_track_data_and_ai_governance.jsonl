We\u2019ll compare different approaches to OCSF implementation and demonstrate how Adobe processes massive security datasets efficiently \u2014 reducing query times by 18%, maintaining 99.4% SLA compliance, and supporting 286 security users across 17 teams with over 4,500 daily queries. By using Databricks' Platform for serverless compute, scalable architecture, and LLM-powered recommendations, Adobe has significantly improved processing speed and efficiency, resulting in substantial cost savings. We\u2019ll also highlight how OCSF enables advanced cross-tool analytics and automation, streamlining investigations. Finally, we\u2019ll introduce Databricks\u2019 new open-source OCSF toolkit for scalable security data normalization and invite the community to contribute. /Sr. Manager, Security Software Engineering\nAdobe /AntiMatter"}
