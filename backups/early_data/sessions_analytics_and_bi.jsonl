To address this, we developed the Generative Insights Tool (GenIT) using Databricks Genie and Mosaic AI to create a real-time insights engine automating SQL generation, data visualization, and narrative creation. GenIT delivers instant insights, enabling faster decisions, greater productivity, and improved consistency while empowering leaders to respond to printer trends. With automated querying, AI-powered narratives, and a chatbot, GenIT reduces inefficiencies and ensures quality data and insights. Our roadmap integrates multi-modal data, enhances chatbot functionality, and scales globally. This initiative shows how HP Print leverages GenAI to improve decision-making, efficiency, and agility, and we will showcase this transformation at the Databricks AI Summit.<\/p>","track":"Analytics and BI","level":"Intermediate","type":"Breakout","industry":["Enterprise Technology"],"category":["AI\/BI, Databricks SQL, Mosaic AI"],"areas_of_interest":["Data Applications, Data Intelligence, Generative AI (LLMs)"],"delivery":["In Person"],"speakers":[{"name":"Weiwei Hu","company":"HP","job_title":"Director, Big Data & Strategic Insights","bio":"Weiwei Hu, Director of Big Data & Strategic Insights at HP, drives AI-led transformation by aligning big data strategy with business priorities.
